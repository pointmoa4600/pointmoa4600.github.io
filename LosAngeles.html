                    <br><Span style="font-size:18px;">Art</Span> The Getty Villa is home to the J. Paul Getty Museum's antiquities collection. Here you'll find art from the ancient Greek and Roman world dating from 6,500 B.C. to A.D. 400.

                    Over 1,200 antiquities are on view in 23 galleries at the Villa. These include monumental sculptures as well as artifacts of everyday life. The entire collection numbers approximately 44,000 antiquities.

                    The galleries are arranged by theme and include Gods and Goddesses, Dionysos and the Theater, and stories of the Trojan War, among others. Seen here: Atheletes and Competition Gallery

                    Specially designed spaces house treasures such as luxury vessels, Cycladic figures, coins, gems, and jewelry.

                    Changing exhibitions feature loans from renowned collections around the world; reflect the collaborative work of the Getty Research Institute, Conservation Institute, and the Museum; and often incorporate works from the Getty Research Institute collection. This display is from the 2008 exhibition Grecian Taste and Roman Spirit: The Society of Dilettanti.

                    <br><Span style="font-size:18px;">Architecture</Span> Constructed in the early 1970s, the Getty Villa is modeled after a first-century Roman country home.

                    The Villa includes details inspired by antiquity, such as these bronze lanterns, which are like those carried along the streets of Pompeii in ancient times.

                    The Villa's gardens include herbs and shrubs inspired by those grown in ancient Roman homes for food and ceremony.

                    Renovation of the Getty Villa site began in 1996. Visitors now start their visit in an open-air Entry Pavilion and walk along a scenic pathway to the heart of the site. As they walk the path, visitors see the Villa from above, peeking through the trees.

                    Visitors' first view of the Villa is through the Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman Theater, an outdoor classical theater based on ancient prototypes and added to the site in the 1996 renovation.

                    <br><Span style="font-size:18px;">Garden</Span>Gardens are integral to the Getty Villa, as they were in the ancient Roman home. Open spaces around the site feature bronze sculptures, fountains, and lush plantings of trees, herbs, and flowers used by the Romans. Seen here: the Outer Peristyle Garden.

                    The Inner Peristyle provides an intimate resting spot at the center of the J. Paul Getty Museum.

                    The Herb Garden is a mosaic of fruit trees and fragrant and colorful annuals and perennials used by the ancient Romans in cooking, ceremony, and medicine.

                    The East Garden is one of the most tranquil spaces at the Villa. This walled sanctuary is shaded by sycamore and laurel trees and animated by splashing water from two sculptural fountains.</p>
